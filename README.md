## Overview

**Stream2Gather** is an online video streaming site designed to provide a seamless media playback experience. It mimics watching YouTube videos with friends in real life by synchronizing play, pause, and seek events within a virtual room using Socket.io. Users can search for videos by keyword and add them to a playlist queue.

Powered by web sockets, **Stream2Gather** allows real-time communication within rooms through live chats. Currently, the platform fully supports YouTube, and the next update will introduce support for Dailymotion and Twitch.
